# Localized Flooding in Schenectady on May 15th, 2022
Most of this information is confined within the twitter thread, however, I think it is important to clarify some of this here. May 15th was a pretty normal Sunday. I was inside of the geosciences building on the Union College campus in Schenectady when a pretty strong rain storm passed by. While this event was brief, it dumped somehwere between 0.81-1.1 inches of rain. Now in the grand scheme of things this isnt actually that impressive. This kind of hourly rainfall event has a recurrance interval of 1-2 years. Sadly, the weather station on campus was not recording 5 minute intervals at the time, but I suspect this muct have all fallen in a fairly short time to elcit the response you are about to see. 

Within 15 minutes of the end of the strongest rainfall rate, my friend and I decided to take a walk around campus to see if there was any flooding near storm drains. To our suprise we could hear an immense rushing noise coming from the usually small and sleepy stream on campus. As we got closer we could hear the clacking of large rocks being transported in water. When we finally made it to the stream this is what we saw.
