# Paleoclimate Lab, University @ Albany

I am currently working in the brand new Paleoclimate Lab at the University at Albany, which is run by Dr. Sujata Murty and Dr. Aubrey Hillman. The lab is set up for coral and lake core analysis, although most of what I highlight here will be about the coral side of the lab.

## ICP-OES
The centerpiece of the lab is a brand new Thermo Scientific iCAP PRO Series ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectroscopy), which we are using to analyze concentrations of Strontium (Sr), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), and Barium (Ba) in coral powder samples. We are also analyzing a slew of other elements on the lake core side of things.

ICP-OES is a method of measuring the concentrations of various elements in a given sample. This is done by first dissolving the sample (most often in acid) and then nebulizing said sample so that it can be introduced to an energy source. In the case of the iCAP PRO, the energy source is a plasma created by energizing Argon gas. 

When the nebulized sample enters the plasma it becomes energized, so much so that valence electrons will “jump up” an orbital, thus entering an “excited” state. As the excited sample moves into the cooler portions of the plasma, the valence electrons will return to their original lower energy state. In doing this, the atoms release energy. This released energy has a wavelength that is unique to each element, which makes it possible for us to detect what elements are present in a given sample. The intensity of energy at each wavelength can then be converted into a concentration value. 

I won’t go into too much detail about the processes so as to not bore you or distract from the rest of what I want to show off. However, if you are interested in learning more [agilent](https://www.agilent.com/en/support/atomic-spectroscopy/inductively-coupled-plasma-optical-emission-spectroscopy-icp-oes/icp-oes-faq) has a great page that can get you started.
