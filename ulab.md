# Paleoclimate Lab, University @ Albany

I am currently working in the brand new Paleoclimate Lab at the Univeristy at Albany, which is run by Dr. Sujata Murty and Dr. Aubrey Hillman. The lab is set up for coral and lake core analysis, although most of what I highlight here will be about the coral side of the lab. 

The center peice of the lab is a brand new ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectrospcopy), which we are using to analyze concentrations of Stontium (Sr), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), and Barium (Ba) in coral powder samples. We are also analyzing a slew of other elements on the lake core side of things.
