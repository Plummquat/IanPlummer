# Paleoclimate Lab, University @ Albany

I am currently working in the brand new Paleoclimate Lab at the University at Albany, which is run by Dr. Sujata Murty and Dr. Aubrey Hillman. The lab is set up for coral and lake core analysis, although most of what I highlight here will be about the coral side of the lab. 

I know it isn't the prettiest way to design this but the headers serve as links to dedicated pages about each of these topics. Thus, if you want to know more simply click on the header.

## [ICP-OES](icpoes.md)
The centerpiece of the lab is a brand new Thermo Scientific iCAP PRO Series ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectroscopy), which we are using to analyze concentrations of Strontium (Sr), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), and Barium (Ba) in coral powder samples. We are also analyzing a slew of other elements on the lake core side of things.
