# New York Climate Reports
The existence of anthropogenic perturbations on the modern-day climate system is quite clear and the projected effects of these human derived changes are largely negative. One can argue about policy and precise details but if you disagree with the first sentence, I recommend you do a more detailed and unbiased reading of the present literature. 

With that aside, I think it is crucial for all scientists to practice communication of their work. Some are better at this than most of us, but you do not learn to be better at something without the process of trial and error. This was a big motivation for me to begin these "climate" reports for NY on a monthly basis. 

I thought it would be both interesting and informative to show how the previous months conditions differed from what is average for that month. While the conditions in a month are not evidence for or against the existence of anthropogenic climate change (again see the first paragraph), they do provide an excellent way to discuss both natural and human derived variability in our system. It is also generally more useful for an audience to see climate information related to their own home as it becomes easier to relate to. 

Do note that the style, detail, and quality of these reports’ changes per month as I’m still finding the best way to go about this. I will share the bare bones of the code for these projects, but I keep tweaking it on a near monthly basis. Feel free to use the code to assess your own states’ climate. Sadly, the data set I use is confined to the continental US. There are other data sets for other countries and regions, so if you are not from the US this is still applicable to you. I will link some example code [here].
